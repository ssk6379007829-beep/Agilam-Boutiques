/**
 * Supabase client factory for the serverless functions.
 *
 * Exists because `createClient()` builds a Realtime client as part of its
 * constructor, and current supabase-js resolves the WebSocket implementation
 * eagerly while doing so. Node only exposes a global `WebSocket` from v22, so on
 * Node 20 that resolution THROWS — "Node.js detected but native WebSocket not
 * found" — and takes the whole request down before a single query runs. In
 * api/place-order.js that lands after the buyer's payment is already captured,
 * which is exactly the failure you never want: money taken, no order.
 *
 * package.json pins `engines.node: 22.x` so deployments are fine, but a
 * developer on Node 20 would hit this on every checkout, and a runtime that
 * quietly downgrades Node would reintroduce it in production. None of these
 * functions ever open a realtime channel — they use PostgREST and the Auth
 * admin API — so we pass a transport placeholder. `RealtimeClient` prefers
 * `options.transport` over the throwing factory lookup, and since no channel is
 * ever subscribed, the placeholder is never constructed.
 *
 * The leading underscore keeps this out of Vercel's /api routing.
