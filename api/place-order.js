/**
 * Vercel serverless function: create the real order(s) for a checkout.
 *
 * Buyers browse without an account, but they cannot order without one: this
 * endpoint requires the buyer's Supabase access token and refuses the request
 * without it (see the sign-in gate in the handler). The `guest_*` columns are
 * still where the delivery details live — the name kept its original meaning of
 * "typed at checkout" rather than "no account behind it".
 *
 * Orders are written with the Supabase service role (bypasses RLS) rather than
 * from the browser client, so one request can create rows for several sellers.
 * The server is the source of truth for prices and boutique ownership: the client
 * only sends product ids + quantities, and we look up the authoritative title,
 * price and boutique from the products table. A cart can span several
 * boutiques, so it is split into one order per boutique — that is what makes
 * each seller see only their own items.
 *
 * For online payments we re-verify the Razorpay signature here (the same HMAC
 * as verify-payment.js) so an order can't be forged without a genuine payment.
 * The signature is checked against every configured merchant account, and the
 * account whose secret matched is the one this request then fetches, captures
 * and refunds against — so a payment taken just before an emergency account
 * switch still settles on the account that actually holds the money.
 *
 * Every order is prepaid. Cash on delivery was removed from the platform
 * (migration 0085) and this endpoint is the gate that enforces it: there is no
 * longer any path that writes an order without a verified Razorpay payment
 * behind it, and a request still asking for `paymentMethod: 'COD'` is refused
 * outright rather than quietly downgraded to something else.
