 * a crawler reaches first — offered a title, a description, and then an empty
 * `<div id="root">`. On `/` that is the whole home page.
 *
 * The links matter more than the prose. The facet landings under
 * /collections/*, /occasions/* and /fabrics/* were reachable from the sitemap
 * and from nowhere else in crawlable HTML, and a URL that only a sitemap knows
 * about is an orphan: Google will take it, but it discounts it and is slow to
 * come back. `/collections` below is what actually links to them.
 *
 * Each hub costs ONE database read, inside the same 1500 ms abort as everything
 * else here, and returns `undefined` if that read fails — a hub without its
 * body is the status quo, whereas a hub that times out is a page that does not

/*
 * ── Why the sitemap is an index of three ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It used to be one document, which meant one edge request did the 5000-row
 * product read AND the 2000-row boutique read, each against the 1500 ms abort
 * in `dbTry`. Losing either one served a sitemap missing a whole section, and
 * the odds of losing one of two reads are roughly twice the odds of losing one.
 *
 * Split, each child does a single read — and the lightest of them, the page
 * sitemap, no longer needs the wide column lists at all, because a facet only
 * needs `category/occasion/fabric` and a city only needs `city`.
 *
 * It also makes Search Console useful: "Pages: 41 discovered, 39 indexed" for
 * one blob says nothing, whereas the same numbers per section say whether it is
 * the catalogue or the directory that is not getting in.

/* ── The Google Merchant Center feed ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `/merchant-feed.xml` — RSS 2.0 with the `g:` namespace, one <item> per live
 * product. Merchant Center is pointed at it on a daily schedule and pulls the
 * whole catalogue; a piece that sells out or is delisted drops out of Shopping
 * within a day, with nothing uploaded by hand.
 *
 * Free Shopping listings are a separate index from web search, with their own
 * surface and considerably more commercial intent per impression. None of the
 * on-page work in this file reaches it — Google will not build a Shopping
 * listing from `Product` markup on a marketplace it has no verified merchant
 * relationship with. This is the only route in.
 *
 * ── Why it lives at the edge and not in api/ ────────────────────────────
 * `api/` holds exactly 12 serverless functions, which IS the Vercel Hobby
 * ceiling — a 13th fails the deploy. Written as `api/merchant-feed.js` first,
 * which is why this comment exists. It is the same reason the sitemap is here
 * rather than at `/api/sitemap`, and the fit is just as good: this is a public,
 * anonymous, cacheable read of the same catalogue the sitemap already walks.
 *
 * ── Fields ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Google's apparel requirements (`gender`, `age_group`, `size`) bind only in a
 * handful of target countries, and India is not among them — so they are
 * emitted where the data is genuinely known and omitted otherwise rather than
 * guessed. A wrong `age_group` is an item disapproval; a missing one is not.
 *
 * One item per product, NOT one per size. Apparel feeds usually emit a variant
 * per size sharing an `item_group_id`, which requires per-size stock that this
 * catalogue does not track — every variant would carry the parent's
 * availability and Merchant Center would eventually flag the mismatch against
 * the landing page.
 */

// `sizes` and `images` are not in the shared column lists because every other
// consumer (sitemap, page metadata) would then carry two arrays it never reads,

// through `dbProductsTry` and inherits its migration-0057 `slug` fallback.
