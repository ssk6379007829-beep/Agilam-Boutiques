/**
 * Verifies the edge SEO layer — `npm run verify:seo`.
 *
 * Vercel middleware does not run under `vite dev`, and its failure mode is
 * deliberately silent: any error serves the plain app, so a broken query looks
 * exactly like a working site while every crawler quietly gets a blank shell.
 * The only way to know it works is to execute it.
 *
 * This runs `middleware.js` exactly as the edge will — real built `index.html`,
 * real database, real `Request` objects — and asserts on what comes back. It
 * has already caught three bugs that were invisible from the browser:
 *
 *   · `id=like.<prefix>` on a uuid column, which Postgres rejects outright
 *     ("operator does not exist: uuid ~~ unknown"), taking every product page's
 *     metadata down with it
 *   · `or=(slug.eq.X,id.eq.X)` comparing a uuid column against a title slug,
 *     which fails the whole query rather than just that branch
 *   · every boutique's `slug` being NULL, so the sitemap listed none of them
 *
 * Run it after any deploy, migration, or change to middleware.js.
 * Requires `.env` with VITE_SUPABASE_URL / VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY.
