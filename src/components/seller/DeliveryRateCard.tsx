/**
 * The shop's delivery rate card — one charge per distance band.
 *
 * A seller used to set ONE delivery charge, next to a free-text "delivery areas"
 * box they could fill with "All Over Tamil Nadu" or "All India". So the same
 * rupees had to cover a parcel handed over the counter and a parcel crossing
 * three states, and one of those two was always priced wrong. Since migration
 * 0077 the bands are priced separately and the buyer's pincode picks one.
 *
 * Blank is a real answer, and the most important one on this screen: it means
 * "I don't deliver that far", and checkout then refuses that address rather than
 * quoting a price the seller never agreed to. That is why the fields are not
 * required and why the empty state says so rather than defaulting to 0 — 0 here
 * would mean free delivery to the far end of India.
 *
 * Shared by the setup wizard's store-settings step and the seller settings
 * screen so the two cannot drift.
