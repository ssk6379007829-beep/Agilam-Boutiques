 * different feeds rather than two orderings of one:
 *
 *   • For You (`followingOnly: false`) is the whole approved market, ordered by
 *     `rankFeed`: recency, likes, views and orders, blended with a per-visit
 *     random term, and the same shop's pieces pulled apart so no boutique holds
 *     a run of the feed. It used to run the followed shops first and hand over
 *     to everyone else at a divider, which meant a buyer who follows three
 *     boutiques saw those three boutiques and little else — the opposite of
 *     what a discovery feed is for. Following now has its own tab, so For You
 *     is free to be discovery.
 *   • Following (`followingOnly: true`) is strictly the shops the buyer follows,
 *     newest first, never reordered and never widened. It answers "what have my
 *     shops posted", and a shuffle would make that unanswerable.
 *
 * `filters` is the buyer's filter sheet and applies to both tabs. Most of it is
 * translated into the query (see `feedQueryFor`); the shop-level part is applied
 * here against the boutique list the catalogue already holds, which is why the
 * feed needs no join and no extra granted column to offer it.
 *
 * Likes are local-first (buyers browse anonymously) and reconciled with the
 * account when there is one.
