/**
 * "Ask my people" in a single tap — make the board and open the share sheet,
 * with nothing in between.
 *
 * The full sheet exists because choosing WHICH pieces to ask about sometimes
 * needs a screen. Most of the time it doesn't: she is on one product and torn,
 * or she has three things saved and wants all three. Making those two cases
 * walk through pick → name → confirm → share is three taps of friction at the
 * exact moment she was about to leave and screenshot into WhatsApp instead.
 *
 * ── The one popup that cannot be removed ────────────────────────────────────
 * A board belongs to someone and notifies them when votes land, so it needs a
 * real account. A signed-out buyer therefore still gets the sign-in sheet —
 * `needsSignIn` — and the caller renders it. Browsing and voting stay anonymous;
 * only owning a board doesn't.
 *
 * ── Why the share can still degrade to a copied link ────────────────────────
 * Creating the board is a round trip and drawing the collage is one fetch per
 * piece, so by the time `navigator.share` is reached the browser may have
 * dropped the transient user activation that it requires — Safari is strict
 * about this, Chrome is not. `shareWithImage` already handles that: a refused
 * share falls through to putting the caption and link on the clipboard, so the
 * worst case is a toast telling her to paste it, never a dead button.
