 *
 * - `local` — details currently in the browser (guest state).
 * - `patch` — an explicit edit the buyer just saved; overrides everything.
 *
 * With no patch this MERGES so nothing is lost: the account (DB) wins where it
 * has a value, otherwise the local value fills it in. So details typed as a
 * guest migrate up on first sign-in, and a later sign-in (or a page refresh,
 * even after logout wiped local) restores whatever the account holds.
 *
 * It is deliberately fault-tolerant: any DB hiccup (RLS lag, a not-yet-run
 * migration such as the `address` column) is swallowed and the LOCAL details are
 * returned untouched, so a refresh can never blank out what's already on screen.
