/**
 * The collections a buyer can browse by.
 *
 * Two inputs, and the difference between them matters:
 *
 *   · the **vocabulary** (migration 0024) decides *which* terms are browsable.
 *     It is the admin's list, so a seller's one-off spelling never becomes a
 *     tile and a newly approved category appears everywhere at once.
 *   · the **catalogue** decides which of those terms are worth showing. A term
 *     with nothing listed under it is dropped: a tile that opens onto an empty
 *     grid is worse than no tile at all.
 *
 * `CATEGORIES` in @/data/demo survives only as artwork. It is six hand-drawn
 * circles from the design file — right for the Home rail, wrong as a source of
 * truth, since it hardcodes a "More" tile that means nothing and cannot know
 * about a category approved last week.
