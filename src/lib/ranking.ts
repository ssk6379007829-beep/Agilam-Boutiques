/**
 * How Agilam decides what is "new", what "sells best", and which boutiques lead.
 *
 * These rails are the shop window. Whatever they show is what most buyers will
 * ever see of the catalogue, and what every seller will compare themselves
 * against — so the rules have to be defensible in one sentence each, and they
 * have to be the *same* rules on Home and on the See-all pages. That is why the
 * scoring lives here rather than inline in the screens.
 *
 * Three principles run through all of it:
 *
 *  1. Rate, not total. A piece listed last week that sold 8 is doing better
 *     than one listed two years ago that sold 30. Totals rank the oldest
 *     listing first, forever, and a new seller can never break in.
 *  2. Confidence, not averages. One 5★ review is not better than two hundred
 *     4.6★ reviews; ratings are pulled toward the catalogue mean until they
 *     have earned their number (`bayesianRating`).
 *  3. Diminishing returns. Every count goes through log1p before it is
 *     normalised, so the one runaway product in the catalogue lifts itself
 *     without flattening everything below it into a rounding error.
 *
 * Nothing here is paid placement: `featured` and any ad slot are deliberately
 * absent from every formula. Ads are sold as ads and are labelled as ads.
