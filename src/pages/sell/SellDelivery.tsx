/**
 * `/sell/delivery-and-payouts` — the two things a seller worries about most.
 *
 * The delivery model here is unusual enough among marketplaces that it has to
 * be explained rather than asserted: MangaiMart does not take the parcel. The
 * seller sets four rates by distance (migrations 0076 and 0077), sets their own
 * dispatch window and return window (0078), and arranges the courier. What the
 * platform owns is the money — collecting it up front and releasing it after
 * delivery — and that half is described with the live hold and promise from
 * `platform_settings`.
 *
 * The zone names below mirror `resolveZone` in `src/lib/deliveryZone.ts` and
 * `zoneFor` in `api/_pricing.js`. If a band is ever added or renamed there, it
 * has to change here too or the page is describing a checkout that no longer
 * exists.

            Most marketplaces take the parcel off you and hand back a fee. MangaiMart does not. The
            piece leaves your shop the way you send it, at a rate you set, in a window you promised —
            and the money for it is already collected before you pack.

                It means you do not deliver there, and it is a real setting rather than an oversight.
                A buyer outside the bands you filled in cannot place the order at all — so you are
                never handed a parcel you have no way to send.
