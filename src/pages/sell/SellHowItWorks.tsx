              She pays online, in full, before anything reaches you. The order lands in your console
              with her name, her address, the pieces and the sizes. MangaiMart is holding that money —
              your part is simply to accept the order and get it ready.

              Within the dispatch window you set. Book a courier and print the label from your
              dashboard, or hand a local parcel to the delivery boy you already use. You record the
              courier and the tracking number, and the buyer can follow it from her orders page — so
              the "where is my parcel" messages mostly stop arriving.

            <Step n={7} title="It is delivered">
              Delivery is recorded against the courier’s record, not against a tap on a button. That
              matters to you as much as to the buyer: it is what starts the clock on your money, and
              it is the evidence if anyone ever says a parcel did not arrive.

              {terms.holdDays} days after delivery, the money goes into your bank account — what the
              pieces sold for, less the {terms.commissionPct}% platform fee. Once a payout is due we
              hold ourselves to {terms.slaHours} hours. Nothing to invoice, nothing to claim, nobody
              to remind.

            <Step n={9} title="She leaves a review, and it compounds">
              Reviews are what rank a shop here — not what it pays. A boutique that photographs
              honestly, dispatches when it said it would and answers its messages climbs the listings
              on its own, and the next buyer arrives without you doing anything.
