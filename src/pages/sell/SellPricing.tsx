 * The fee, the payout hold and the ad rates are all read live (see
 * `useSellerTerms`). Nothing on this page is a typed-in number except the three
 * example prices, which are only there to make the arithmetic legible.
 *
 * The worked examples deliberately use `terms.cutOf`/`terms.netOf` rather than
 * doing the sum inline, so the column always adds up on screen even when the
 * rate is one that does not divide neatly.
 *
 * "Platform fee", never "commission" — see the note at the top of
 * `sellContent.ts`. The number is not softened anywhere on this page; it is
 * explained instead. Hiding it would be the one thing worse than the number.

              It does not say who ends up with the delivery charge, and that is
              on purpose, not an oversight in the writing.

              Migration 0076 made delivery the SELLER'S: the seller sets the
              four rates and arranges the courier. But `settle_boutique_payout`
              (still on the 0025 model, last redefined in 0078) pays out
              `total − fee` and only RECORDS `shipping_fee` in
              `payouts.fees` — it is not added to the seller's amount. So today
              the platform collects the seller's delivery charge and the seller
              pays the courier out of the goods money.

              That looks like 0076 having outrun the payout function rather
              than a decision anybody made. Until it is settled one way or the
              other, this page must not claim either — "you keep the delivery
              fee" would be false today, and "we keep it" would publish what is
              probably a bug. Once the owner decides, say it plainly here and on
              /sell/delivery-and-payouts.
