 *
 * The four tones are a deliberate split, not a palette:
 *
 * - `success` — the thing they asked for happened. Past tense, no action left.
 * - `error`   — it did not happen, and the cause is ours or the network's.
 *               "Could not save your changes", "Photo upload failed".
 * - `warning` — it did not happen, and the cause is something they can fix
 *               right now. "Pick a reason", "Only 2 left in stock". Splitting
 *               these off `error` matters: a form nag styled as a failure
 *               reads as "the app is broken" rather than "your turn".
 * - `info`    — neither a win nor a refusal; a neutral statement of fact.
